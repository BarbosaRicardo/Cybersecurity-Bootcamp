What is the concept of the Cache Tool and why is it relevant to broader cybersecurity and privacy issues?

---

In the broader scope, cache is temporary data that is saved to one's computer in order to provide a faster experience for the user browsing the Web. According to Google: _clearing [the cache] fixes certain problems, like loading or formatting issues on sites._

## Reasons why this is important for cybersecurity

- Clearing the cache protects one's personal information

- When visiting a website, browser stores locations visited, files used to run an online application, downloads

- If using a public computer, clearing the cache prevents anyone who uses the computer and the browser after you may be able to see your activity

- Cache's temporary files may be a target for adware, malware, and virus files

A browser can hold one's history indefinitely.  The purpose is to help one relocate one's way back to a place on the web they have visited in the past.  However the reality is that this can be more hurtful than helpful.  By simply visiting the site, content can be saved on your computer than can be used against you.
