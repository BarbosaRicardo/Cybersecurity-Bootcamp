# Google Drive Access Controls

---

What is the concept of the Google Drive Access Controls and why is it relevant to broader cybersecurity and privacy issues?

---

There are three main access control schemes:

1. Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

2. Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

3. Role-Based Access Control (BAC)

## MAC

- Based on the idea of tiers such as admin user, regular user, and public user

- Users can access everything at or below their level

## DAC

- Grants permission on a per-entitity basis

- This is the standard Google Drive permission system

## RBAC

- All users are placed in one or more roles, and on a per-entity basis, one grants permissions to specific roles
